# crispy pancake haxeflixel project
3 reasons why i made this:

- it looks easier to me in comparsion with pygame
- haxe = real actionscript 4 (aka the language that is used for flash games)
- friday night funkin' modding

## compile instructions
to compile you only need latest version of haxe and these haxelib stuff:

```
flixel
flixel-ui
flixel-tools
flixel-addons
openfl
lime
```

now you have to open cmd (or powershell) in this directory and run these commands:

- `lime build html5` (for html5)
- `lime build windows` (for windows, visual studio community is strongly required for this)
- `lime build mac` (for mac)
- `lime build linux` (for linux)
